            Point out the new multibounce effects that appear in each image. 
        </b></p>
        <p>
            In the m=0 image, the only thing that we can see is the light source, which makes sense because in zero-bounce, the light isn’t going anywhere outside of the source! As we continue to the m=1 image, things begin appearing!
            We can see our walls and floor being lit up, as well as darkened spheres with a small amount of illumination on each. Then, in the m=2 image, we can see that our mirror sphere is beginning to reflect the scene around it (excluding the ceiling) and we can see some red being reflected
            on the floor as well! Additionally, our ceiling has become visible, and although our glass ball is still mostly dark, there is some blue reflection around it as well. As we move onto m=3, our glass ball really begins looking more “glass-like”, as we can see how it is refracting the
            light going into it; it also begins showing a caustic under it. The mirror ball can now reflect the ceiling as well, but it still shows a darkened glass ball in its reflection. Next, we go to m=4, and we can see that the mirror ball is now able to accurately reflect the glass ball;
            the glass ball is now reflecting a small light point that we can see on the right wall! From m=4 to m=5, there doesn’t seem to be any new multibounce effects, other than a small increase in general brightness. There doesn’t seem to be any new effects for m=100 either.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><b>
            Explain how these bounce numbers relate to the particular effects that appear. Make sure to include all screenshots.
        </b></p>
        <p>
            At m=0, since there’s no bounce, the only thing we can see are the light rays coming from the light source to the camera, which is why it makes sense that the only thing we can see is the ceiling light! At m=1, we can begin seeing the lights that bounce of an object into the camera, so that’s why the ceilings and the small areas of the spheres become illuminated. Then at m=2, the ceiling is now lit up because of the two bounce illumination, and the mirror ball is now reflecting the parts of the scene with one bounce (so everything that was visible in m=1). At m=3, the mirror ball can now reflect parts of the scene with two bounce, and the light rays hitting the glass ball can refract and hit the camera again. At m=4, the glass ball refracting the lights now bounces again and can create a light spot on the right wall. Additionally, the mirror ball can now accurately reflect the light from the glass ball.

        <h3 align="middle">Part 4. Depth of Field</h3>
        <b>
            For these subparts, we recommend using a microfacet BSDF scene to show off the cool out of focus effects you can get with depth of field!
        </b>
        <p><b>
            In a few sentences, explain the differences between a pinhole camera model and a thin-lens camera model. 
        </b></p>
        <p>
            In a pinhole camera model, we use a small hole to project an inverted image of the scene onto the surface. This assumes light travels straight and ignores lens distortion.
            In the thin-lens camera model, we use a thin lens to focus light onto image sensors. This takes into account the properties of the lease, focal length, aperture size, and used to properties such as depth of field and distortion.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><b>
            Show a "focus stack" where you focus at 4 visibly different depths through a scene. Make sure to include all screenshots.
